<p>Dogs and humans have been living side-by-side for about 15,000 years, so you might think we know each other pretty well. But there's more to dogs than fetching and playing dead. Here are some little-known facts about man's best friend. Dogs can be as smart as 2-year-old children, according to research presented in 2009 at a meeting of the American Psychological Association. Border collies are the top dogs in the intelligence category, with some in the breed capable of understanding up to 200 words. Poodles, German shepherds, Golden retrievers and Dobermans round out the top five smartest breeds. (The most popular breed in America, the Labrador retriever, comes in at number seven.) Older breeds like hound dogs, bulldogs and beagles are among the slow learners of the doggie world, the researchers reported.</p>

<h2>Facts about dogs</h2>
<ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Your dog is as smart as a 2-year-old toddler.
                There’s a reason your tot and your pup get along so well: they speak the same language. Or at least, they likely understand roughly the same number of words and gestures — 250!</li>
            <br><li>Dogs and cats both slurp water the same way.
                This may be hard to believe since dogs are such messy drinkers, but just like cats, our canine friends bend the tip of their tongue and raise liquid in a column up to their mouths.</li>
            <br><li>Your dog does have a sense of time — and misses you when you’re gone.
                If you think your dog knows when it’s time for dinner or a walk, you’re right! Dogs pick up on our routines and habits, and they also sense how much time has passed. One study showed how dogs responded differently to their owners being gone for different lengths of time.</li>
            <br><li>Your dog’s whiskers help him “see” in the dark.
                Okay, it’s not quite night-vision or a super power, but those whiskers pick up on even subtle changes in air currents, providing your pup with information about the size, shape, and speed of things nearby. </li>
        </ol>
</ul>
